supporter: I see. That sounds like a difficult situation. Could you tell me a bit more about your job?
Label: followup

Label: clarification

supporter: That is understandable. People can be hard to deal with at times. What did the co-worker do that upset you?
Label: followup

seeker: We have a set process of how we are to screen employees as they enter the workplace.  She doesn't follow the procedures or makes up her own way to do them because she is lazy to either stand up or greet them.  She is also rude at times to customers and has an attitude that is not friendly.
Label: none

supporter: That's unfortunate and unprofessional. Have you tried talking to your co-worker about the issue in a calm and constructive manner? Perhaps, it would be beneficial to schedule a private meeting with her to discuss the issue and come up with a resolution that both of you can agree on. Also, regarding the investigation that she has started, it may be helpful to talk to your manager or HR department to ensure that the situation is handled appropriately.
Label: none

teacher: OK so the topic is 'Work' and question: IS job satisfaction more important than salary when choosing a job?'
Label: followup

student: I believe so, because if you had a high salary but a job that you didn't really enjoy, it would be difficult for you to be happy. It's important to do the work that we can enjoy because it is our main occupation during the day
Label: none

teacher: OK thanks <STUDENT>...maybe another sentence would be good here ....to add support ...like a specific case (as in soemthing that wouldn't be enjoyable if you see what i mean
Label: none

student: that's the reason why after high school it would be better to make a conscious (I know the spelling is wrong) decision. you mean for example a subject?
